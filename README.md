# HackNU-2.0

It is a online hackathon conducted by the NIIT University from 27.05.2020 to 03.05.2020.
It was immense pleasure to be a part of this hackathon, great opportunity to work and build application while everyone is working remotely.

Our team hacking-cheetahs made a donations application interface under the category #this-pandemic.

# Description

The app is called ConnectU. 
It's an app that helps organizations distribute food and essential items to deliever to the needy in this #pandemic situation.
The application is designed separately for the donors and the distributers. Currently the app is designed only for food distribution purpose, later we plan to include more features like non-food items and electronic devices, etc. Thus this application can be further scaled up not only for pandemic but also to monitor many donation activities by tracking feature across the organizations.
This app will be very helpful to maintain social distancing in the current scenario.
